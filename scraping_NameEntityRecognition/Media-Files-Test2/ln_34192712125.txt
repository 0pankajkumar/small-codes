34192712125;b'The desire to build his own house led a cousin to first kidnap his minor brother and later kill him and dump his body in a canal in Uttar Pradesh\'s Muradnagar area. Five persons have been arrested and efforts are being made to trace the body. \n \nAccording to the police, the incident took place on Tuesday around 10:30 pm in North-East Delhi\'s Nang Nagri area. Family members of the 17-year-old deceased informed the police that their son had gone to the nearby park to play but had not returned home. "Sahil Mehra\'s father received a ransom call on his mobile phone wherein the kidnappers demanded a sum of Rs 1 crore for the release of their son. The kidnappers were well aware of the fact that the family had recently made a huge profit in the business and would be able to pay the desired amount," the police said. \n \nThe police registered a case of kidnapping and various teams were formed to trace the victim. The Crime Branch was also roped in. With the help of technical surveillance and local intelligence, Pankaj alias Babbal was zeroed in and taken into custody. Pankaj was Sahil\'s cousin who lived in the same house. Four other accused have been identified as Mursaleem alias Salim, Shoaib, Salman and Naseemuddin alias Chotu. \n \nThe accused said that they had killed the boy after giving him a cold-drink laced with chemicals. After he fell unconscious and they were sure he had died, they dumped him in the canal. \n \nPankaj told investigators that according to the plan he had taken Sahil along with him near an ATM in GTB Nagar. The four other accused also reached near the ATM and pretended to have coincidentally met Pankaj. \n \nPankaj later made some excuse and sent Sahil with his friends saying that he would join them later. They had decided to use code words to communicate: \'P\'for if the police were informed and \'M\'if Pankaj wanted him to be killed. \n \n"Pankaj knew that his uncle had a good bank balance. He wanted to stay in his own house and needed money for it. Since he lived in the same house, he knew when his uncle had informed the police. That moment he sent \'P\' as a message to let them know that the police was informed. Later he thought he would be in trouble and sent \'M\' as a message indicating that he wanted them to kill Sahil," added the official.'
