It\'s the first country we have signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with," High Commissioner Ashraf said. \n\nIn Singapore, Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to visit the Indian Heritage Centre in Little India, where he will launch a permanent platform to bring Indian artisans, craftsmen to showcase their crafts to support rural livelihood.
