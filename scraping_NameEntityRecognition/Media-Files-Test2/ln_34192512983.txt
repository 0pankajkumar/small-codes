The RLD had even refused to join the Congress-SP alliance for the 2017 UP Assembly polls. However, in the latest bypoll, RLD nominee in \nKairana Tabassum Hasan supported by the Congress, BSP and SP defeated the BJP candidate. \n \nThe writing on the wall is clear. BJPs exit and success of Congress and its allies is guaranteed. In Kairana, the mahagathbandhans success is evident, Congress spokesperson Pramod Tiwari said. \n \nIn the Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra Congress ally NCPs nominee defeated the BJP, paving the way for a 2019 pact, said party sources. \n \nOn its own, the Congress won Palus Kadegaon Assembly bypoll in Maharasahtra, Ampati in Meghalaya, Shahkot in Punjab and RR Nagar in Karnataka. Sources said the RR Nagar win proved the charges of tampering with voter ID cards wrong. Similarly, the Shahkot win proved the popularity of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and the Ampati win made Congress the single largest party in Meghalaya.'
