34192710073;b'Surat: Ravi Pokals father Ramesh manages to bring home just around Rs 12,000 every month. He runs a small paan shop in Puna village near Geetanagar and dreams of his son become a chartered accountant. Despite the struggle for money, Ravi toiled 12 hours a day to make his fathers dream come true. Ravi has also started attending CA coaching classes. His school Sanskardeep Madhavbaug had also waived off his fees. By obtaining 660\\700 marks, he is probably among the toppers in the state. Running a family in Rs 12,000 a month is very difficult, but my children are very understanding and know the value of education, said Ramesh, who had to quit studies mid-way due to financial constraints. tnn'
