34192712096;b"Two of the country's oldest trains, Deccan Queen which completes 88 years and Punjab Mail which completes 106 years, will mark the milestones on June 1. Sources said that these trains have been chosen by the Railway Board for upgradation as part of the celebrations. \n \nAs per the Board's plans, the modifications will include vinyl wrapping of coaches, equipping them with fire extinguishers, information posters, braille signage, new upholdetry, compressed cushioned seats, dustbins inside coaches and adequate maintenance along with onboard inspection every two hours. The modifications in Deccan Queen will be complete by August 15. \n \nThe introduction of Deccan Queen between two premier cities of Maharashtra on June 1, 1930 was a landmark for the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the precursor to Central Railway. \n \nThe origins of the Bombay-to- Peshawar Punjab Mail are unclear but based on a complaint by an irate passenger on October 12, 1912 about the 'late arrival of the train by a few minutes at Delhi', it has been inferred that Punjab Mail made her maiden run from Ballard Pier station on June 1, 1912. Punjab Mail is over 16 years older than the more glamorous Frontier Mail."
