The march was held to remember the children who were among the more than 80 killed since the start of protests more than a month ago. \n \nThe Nicaraguan Human Rights Center said six people were killed in the capital of Managua, with five others killed in other parts of the country and 79 injured. The army said it was treating some of the injured. \n    \nThe European Parliament on Thursday condemned what it called "brutal repression" in Nicaragua and called for elections to be held earlier, echoing other calls for Ortega make the 2021 presidential election earlier. \n \nIn a letter to Ortega published on Twitter, business association COSEP urged the 72-year-old president to push up the vote to a date agreed between the government and civilian representatives. \n    \n"Given the magnitude of this crisis, we urge you to undertake every effort in your power to find a peaceful solution before we find ourselves immersed in an even more tragic situation," the letter said. \n \nOrtega told supporters that Nicaragua "is not private property" in response to the COSEP demand, local newspaper La Prensa reported. \n \nProposed changes to Nicaragua\'s social security system last month triggered the student-led protests. \n \n(Additional reporting by Delphine Schrank and Tomas Bravo in Mexico City; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Jeffrey Benkoe) \n \nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed. \n \n \nUpdated Date: Jun 01, 2018 04'
