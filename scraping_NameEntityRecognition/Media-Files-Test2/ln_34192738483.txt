It also refuted that any such agreement was concluded. "IAF has also confirmed that Global Marketing SP Ltd has not participated in any of the meetings held towards finalisation of the contract dated 26.11.2014 with STE Ukraine," stated the rejoinder. \n \nIt, however, confirmed that the Embassy of Ukraine in India had sent a request to MHA and MEA, dated 06.03.2018 for legal assistance in investigation of a criminal case filed against officials of Ukraine Government\'s State Owned Enterprise (STE). \n \n"This is as per international treaty between India and Ukraine. This request contains a list of questions to be answered. There are no allegations against any Indian Govt. official. Government of India has only been requested to render legal assistance," it said.'
