34192688533;b'After the Karnataka results, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is set to revise its strategy in Rajasthan. In a rare show, the RSS had come forward and openly campaigned for the BJP in Karnataka, but results fell short of expectations. \n \nThis has prompted the RSS to start laying ground work in Rajasthan to revise its strategy. "The road to Delhi passes through Rajasthan, and to ensure a government in 2019, RSS cannot afford to repeat Karnataka mistakes," said a RSS functionary. \n \nRSS has already begun its outreach and organisation strengthening work in Rajasthan, but now they are working on micro-management to avoid Karnataka mistakes. \n \nIn order to achieve this, extra efforts will be made to send out a clear message that state and Central governments as well as the BJP and RSS are on the same page regarding various issues of the state. They said they will also work to smother factionalism within the state unit of the BJP. \n \nThe RSS is also drawing plans for micro-management of castes at localised and constituency level; while at the same time a pro-Dalit approach will actively be adopted.'
