34192624413;b'A developer allowing a home buyer to carry out fit-outs before receiving OC doesnt mean that its complete possession. In an order, the MahaRERA appellate tribunal exposed a cooked up story of a developer. \n \nThe homebuyers case was dismissed in November 2017 by MahaRERA as the builder told the authority that the homebuyer had taken possession in February 2017, before MahaRERA came into force. The homebuyer appealed against the order, and the tribunal found out that the developer had only given license to perform fit-outs and the OC was received only in March 2018. Thus the project fell under RERA and asked MahaRERA to hear the case. \n \nBhavana Duvey was aggrieved by an order of November 27, 2017 recorded by the MahaRERA, dismissing her complaint on the ground that she had received possession of the flat on February 24, 2017. \n \nThe Tribunal held that the observation of the MahaRERA member of receiving possession of the flat on February 24, 2017 are not correctly borne out from the available record. The letter dated February 24, 2017 issued by the developer Teerth developers illustrated it is a license to enter into the flat in pursuance to the agreement of sale dated October 2014, and it is only for completing fit out of furniture, fixtures, electrification etc. The developer received occupancy certificate on March 2, 2018 thus there was no handing over possession in legal terms as on February 24, 2107. \n \nFinally, while passing the order, the tribunal said that developer was demonstrating chicanery to evade RERA Act. Hence the matter warrants remand to be heard by the MahaRERA member. Thus setting aside the Nov 27, 2017 order, the tribunal asked the party to appear before MahaRERA authorities on July 3.'
