34192509336;b'The Denver Broncos dismissed Beth Bowlen\'s bid to become controlling owner of the NFL franchise as she is "not capable or qualified".\n\nBowlen, the daughter of Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, wants to be in control of the team.\n\nHowever, the Pat Bowlen Trust  which was set up in 2014 when Pat stepped down due to his ongoing battle with Alzheimer\'s disease  is not on board with her bid.\n\n"We have thoroughly evaluated whether Beth is capable of succeeding her father as controlling owner," the trust said in a statement.\n\n"We have determined that she is not capable or qualified at this time."\n\nThe Pat Bowlen Trust is run by three individuals: Broncos president and CEO Joe Ellis, team counsel Rich Silvka and local attorney Mary Kelly. \n\n"Pat did not designate Beth as a trustee or appoint her to a leadership position, nor did he instruct the trustees to specifically mentor her," the trust said.\n\n"He made it clear that his children were not automatically entitled to a role with the team and that they would have to earn that opportunity through their accomplishments, qualifications and character."\n\nBeth Bowlen believes she has met all of the requirements to become a controlling owner of the team. The specifications set out for controlling ownership were five years of "senior management experience", high-level education and leadership and integrity qualifications.\n\nBowlen has worked with the Broncos in the past and has a law degree from the University of Denver. She believes she is qualified and her family has offered support.\n\nMinority owners John (Pat\'s brother) and his wife Kerry would like to see Beth granted the opportunity.\n\n"As minority owners of the team, we would be proud and thrilled to have [Beth] as the leader of this franchise," the statement read. "There is strong support as well from fans who favour her bid for controlling ownership."'
