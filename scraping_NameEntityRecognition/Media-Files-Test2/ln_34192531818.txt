34192531818;b'/PRNewswire/ -- AWE (Augmented World Expo), the world\'s #1 AR+VR conference and expo, officially opened its doors yesterday in Silicon Valley, kicking off the biggest event in its nine-year history. With nearly 6,000 attendees, over 400 speakers, 400 journalists, and nearly 250 exhibitors in 100,000-square-feet expo including a 20,000-square-feet Playground, AWE USA 2018 is showcasing the most cutting-edge AR and VR solutions ever gathered in a single location. \n\nAnnouncements at today\'s Press Conference included innovations in enterprise, entertainment, cinema, smart wearables, sensing suits, vision and audio enhancement, mixed reality sports and 3-D smartphone technology. \n\nIn addition, AugmentedReality.org  the non profit behind AWE  kicked off an initiative to promote collaboration on an Open AR Cloud. For those interested to stay informed about this initiative  please sign up at: OpenARCloud.org. \n\n"The AR Cloud will be the single most important software infrastructure in computing, far more valuable than Facebook\'s social graph or Google\'s pagerank index," said AWE Founder and CEO, Ori Inbar. "However, there is a growing concern in the industry that this critical infrastructure could be controlled by corporations and also be fragmented across too many instances. For this reason we are kicking off a historical endeavour to ask the XR industry to come together to collaborate on an Open AR Cloud that will act as a standardized, interoperable and accessible foundation for all developers and creators to build upon." \n\nAWE also announced the official dates for AWE Europe 2018 on October 18-19 in Munich, Germany and AWE Tel Aviv 2018 on November 5. Also announced was the latest schedule of AWE Nite meetups which take place monthly in San Francisco, New York, Toronto and Chicago. Details for AWE Asia will be announced shortly. \n\nThe AWE 2018 Online Media Kit, including the press conference news and all other AWE-related announcements, can be accessed here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/awo4zy3ay3xmehx/AACpYnQYX4X6t0KMjT_wdONMa?dl=0 \n\nHighlights of today\'s press conference announcements include: \n\nKopin today unveiled the world\'s first gesture and voice-controlled wearable smart screen, weighing 1.5 ounces and surpassing any other market product in modularity, battery and cost. http://www.kopin.com \n\nRealWear revealed the first commercially available \'ruggedized\' AR head-mounted wearable certified for ATEX Zone 1 and C1/D1 Potentially Explosive Environments. https://www.realwear.com \n\neSight, known for its high-resolution and high-camera contrast technologies, introduced a breakthrough augmented reality headset platform designed to provide enhanced vision in precision environments. https://www.esighteyewear.com/technology \n\nWikitude revealed SDK 8, the 8th version of its award-winning augmented reality SDK, now featuring Scene Recognition, Extended Object Tracking and Instant Targets.  https://www.wikitude.com \n\nVyking introduced what it bills as the \'first mobile AR marketing platform," a lightweight SDK that delivers 3D creative deployment and analytics.  https://www.leadingedgeonly.com \n\nVuzix revealed their partnership with Qualcomm on the new Snapdragon XR1 platform to develop next generation smart glasses, as well as a new partnership with Plessey Semiconductor.  https://www.vuzix.com/ \n\nKaayatech showcased its groundbreaking HoloSuit motion-capture suit, allowing users to fully immerse themselves with full-body physical  https://www.holosuit.com \n\nUltrahaptics launched STRATOS Explore, a new SDK for creating 3D haptic sensations in mid-air. https://www.ultrahaptics.com \n\nNuHeara demonstrated its new augmented hearing solutions, which amplify digital audio while subduing inessential ambient noises, all while keeping the wearer aware of their surroundings.  https://www.nuheara.com \n\nZappar announced ZapBox 2.0, a Mixed Reality kit allowing developers and businesses to reimagine how they design, build and create room-scale interactive 3D experiences.  https://www.zappar.com \n\nScopeAR debuted a new AR platform to deliver both real-time remote assistance and AR smart instructions. https://www.scopear.com \n\nvSports launched and demonstrated for the first time vGolf, the first Mixed Reality golf simulation and training system. http://vsports.io \n\nResonai, in collaboration with The Tech Museum of Innovation, presented The Animaker, an immersive exhibit that invites visitors to collaborate with AI-powered robots. https://www.resonai.com/#!/home \n\nVarjo revealed the world\'s first cinematic-quality (40X resolution) Mixed Reality technology to seamlessly merge real and virtual worlds in cinematic fidelity. https://varjo.com \n\nMantis Vision demonstrated its 3D sensing solutions based on structured light and a smart decoding algorithm, for front 3D facial  cameras. http://www.mantis-vision.com \n\nFor photos of AWE 2018, click here. \n\nTo see AWE 2018\'s full agenda of almost 400 speakers, visit http://www.augmentedworldexpo.com/agenda and the full list of exhibitors at  https://augmentedworldexpo.com/exhibitors/. \n\nFollow AWE on Twitter at @ARealityEvent and the official event hashtag #AWE2018 \n\nFor more information on today\'s announcements or to request a complimentary press pass to AWE USA 2018 by emailing jennifer@lightspeedpr.com.
