34192575435;b'Rajkot: Two of the three persons , who had duped an elderly man of a Rs 5 ,000 note that was demonetized in 1965, were arrested from their houses in Rajkot on Thursday. \nAccording to the case details, Atul Dholakia (64), a resident of Lakshmivadi area in Rajkot, Rajendra Dholakia (51), a resident of Junagadh and Lalsinh Chaudhary had duped Bhavangiri Goswami (60), a resident of Rajlakshmi Society on Morbi Road in Rajkot last year. \nWhile Atul and Rajendra have been arrested, Lalsinh is still at large. \nAs Goswami was in need of money, he decided to sell off the Rs 5,000 note, for which he contacted Atul, who promised to get him customers. Atul introduced Goswami to Rajendra who introduced him to Lalsinh, who said he was willing to buy the note for Rs 22 lakh as the note had antique value. \nOn October 14 last year, the trio had asked Goswami to come to Nakshatra Building on Sadhu Vaswani Road. There, the accused had taken the note from Goswami. They told him that they would have to check its authenticity and assuring him that they return in a short time, they went, never to return. Seven months later, Goswami decided to lodge the complaint against them, said University police station sub-inspector N B Danger. \nGoswamis son Manoj died after he was shot at by unidentified assailants, six months ago. Goswami had to spend Rs 35 lakh on his treatment and even had to sell off his house. Yet, his son could not survive and the assailants could not be arrested. As Goswami was debt-ridden, he had decided to sell off the note.'
