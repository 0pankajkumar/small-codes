If you may have noticed, we have not put up a paywall, unlike many news organisations,  as we want to keep our journalism open. We believe journalism should be open, fearless and unbiased. Open information helps with informed decisions. \n \nFair and open journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce; despite all the hardships we still do it, because we believe our perspective matters  because it might well be your perspective, too. Today more people are reading Kashmir Observer than ever, but only a handful are paying, and advertising revenues across the media industry are falling fast. \n \nIf everyone who reads our reporting, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure and we will be able to keep our and your perspective going. So if we may ask, we ask your help in keeping the Kashmir Observers journalism fair and square. \n \nSupport Our Journalism'
