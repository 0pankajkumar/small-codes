34192728975;b'( ) - Brexit Secretary David Davis is creating a Brexit plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland, The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday. \n \nDavis is drawing a proposed 10-mile (16-km)-wide trade buffer zone along the border that would be in effect for local traders like dairy farmers after Britain leaves the bloc, the newspaper said. \n \nThe Brexit minister\'s plan is a revision of the "max fac" or "maximum facilitation" plan, the report said, citing a source. \n \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May previously pledged to take the UK out of the EU customs union by considering two options. One would be "max fac" in which the UK and EU would be entirely separate customs areas but would try to use technology to reduce friction and costs at the border. \n    \nThe other option being considered is a "customs partnership", according to which the UK would cooperate with the EU more closely and collect tariffs on its behalf with no requirement of declarations of goods crossing the border. \n \nThe European Union previously criticized May for not setting out how the UK would achieve a frictionless border with the EU without erecting a land border to control goods between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \n    \nBritain suggested earlier this month that it would be willing to extend the use of EU tariffs as a backstop if there were delays in ratification of a Brexit deal to avoid a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, adding the government did not want to use that option. \n \n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Cooney) \n \nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed. \n \n \nUpdated Date: Jun 01, 2018 06'
