34192530547;b'Superstar-turned-politician Rajinikanth found himself in the eye of a political storm over his comment on Wednesday about the anti-Sterlite protest wherein he claimed that "anti-social elements had turned the May 22 protest into a violent one" and that that too many protests would turn the state into a "graveyard". His comments earned the wrath of several opposition parties including DMK, but interestingly, was supported by the ruling AIADMK. \n \nMeanwhile, the security at his residence was tightened following some fringe outfits\' announcement that they would picket his residence to demand an apology for branding the protestors as anti-social. To that end, a large posse of police was deployed in the upmarket Poes Garden locality with restrictions on vehicle entry. \n \nOn Thursday, Rajinikanth expressed regret for addressing reporters rudely and tweeted, "I did not intend to hurt anyone. If I had hurt someone, I regret." \n \nAfter his comments went wide, DMK working president MK Stalin, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam leader TTV Dhinakaran and VCK\'s Thol Thirumavalavan hit out at the aspiring politician with Stalin wondering if Rajinikanth was indeed making his own view heard. \n \n"There is a doubt if this is his voice, as BJP has also been making such remarks. Whatever it is, he is a superstar and himself has said anti-social elements had infiltrated the protesters. It would be good for the country if he could identify such persons," he said. \n \nDhinakaran said the anti-Sterlite agitation was a people\'s protest. "Are the dead or those injured anti-social elements?" he questioned. MDMK founder Vaiko said Rajinikanth\'s comments have "hurt crores of Tamils. \n \nInterestingly, the AIADMK, which was highly critical of the actor for his "system failure" comment, lauded him for speaking "with a conscience" and said his comments were "welcome".'
