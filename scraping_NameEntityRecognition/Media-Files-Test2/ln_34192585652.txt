On Thursday, Reuters reported AT&T finally dropped its legal challenge against that complaintand more broadly, the FTCs ability to protect net neutralityand is in talks to settle with the agency. \n \nAT&T, the second-largest mobile service provider in the US, initially announced that it would petition the Supreme Court to review the case on the grounds that the FTC has no jurisdiction over the companys broadband services. AT&T has since pulled an about-face on those plans, informing court officials that it will not pursue its appeal, allowing the FTC to finally continue its legal case against the mobile carrierthough the telecom giant will try to reach an agreement to avoid allowing the complaint going to trial. \n\n       \nWe have decided not to seek review by the Supreme Court, to focus instead on negotiating a fair resolution of the case with the Federal Trade Commission, a spokesperson for AT&T told Gizmodo. \n\n \nThe apparent end to a messy legal fight marks two potential victories for consumers. First and foremost, it presents a possible settlement that could secure refunds for AT&T customers who were misled by the companys promise of unlimited data plans that were actually severely throttled and slowed. \n\n \nAccording to the FTCs original complaint from 2014, AT&T began throttling data speeds for customers with unlimited plans after using as little as two gigabytes of data in a single billing period. AT&T slowed the download speeds of customers by as much as 90 percent. The FTC reported the mobile carrier throttled at least 3.5 million customers a total of 25 million times. (AT&T has since toned down its throttling practices and now issues notifications about slowdowns in bill statements and text messages.) \n        \n \n   \nIn addition to some justice for the allegedly deceptive data plans, the lapsed legal challenge also means AT&T is dropping its claims that the FTC cant regulate it, potentially restoring some of the agencys ability to enforce net neutrality protections. \n\n \nThe crux of AT&Ts argument hinged on the fact that the FTC doesnt have authority from Congress to provide oversight over common carrier services. While the complaint was over wireless internet services, AT&T claimed that because it provides mobile and landline voice services, it should be classified as a common carrier and therefore be made immune to the FTCs actions. \n\n \nThat position initially worked for AT&T, when the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the companys favor in 2016. Had that ruling stood, it would have allowed all companies that offer common carrier services to avoid punishment from the FTC even when offering non-common carrier services. However, earlier this year a ruling from an en banc session of the US Court of Appeals ruled the FTC did, in fact, have jurisdiction over broadband services provided by telecom companies. \n        \n \n   \nWhile the FTC has had some of its regulatory powers restored, it still does not have the same levers that the Federal Communications Commission had under the Open Internet Order. The FTC can punish ISPs that fail to keep net neutrality promises, but companies can just forgo making those promises in order to avoid penalties. Comcast almost immediately removed its pledge to not create internet fast lanes the day after the FCC announced its plan to repeal net neutrality protections. \n\n \nWinning the fight to preserve net neutrality protections remains a far better solution for consumers than the very narrow oversight now granted to the FTC. \n\n       \n[ Reuters , Ars Technica ]'
