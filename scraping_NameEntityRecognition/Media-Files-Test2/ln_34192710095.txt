34192710095;b'Surat: The power loom weaving industry in the city has urged the Union government to conduct a detailed survey on the impact of Goods and Services Tax (GST). \nIn a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the power loom industry leaders stated that the condition of weavers has deteriorated post GST. More than 50,000 workers have lost their jobs in weaving and over 4 lakh have been rendered jobless in the entire textile value chain in the city. \nSince November 2017, at least 1 lakh power loom machines have been sold in scrap and weavers have been forced to reduce production of man-made fabric (MMF) by operating in the single shift of eight hours. \n\nPresident of Pandesara Weavers Association Ashish Gujarati said, The textile processors, yarn spinners and embroidery units are allowed to claim ITC refund, but when it comes to weaving, there is a clear discrimination by the central government. \n\n\nAccording to Gujarati, the average ITC refund amount per loom per year comes to around Rs 7,000. The city has six lakh power loom machines and the total annual ITC refund amount is pegged at Rs 420 crore. \nProduction cost of MMF per metre in Gujarat is 50% higher compared to Maharashtra. Units investing Rs 10 crore in Maharashtra are getting Rs 5 crore subsidy from the government, whereas those investing in Gujarat are getting capital subsidy of just Rs 2.5 crore, Gujarati said. \nMayur Golwala of Sachin Powerloom Association said, Due to non refund of ITC, capital investment in new machines has been hampered. The cost of raw material for decentralized unit is almost six per cent more compared to the integrated units. \nGolwala added, The government should immediately conduct a detailed survey of Surats weaving sector and provide us with the long-term solution. Otherwise, the industry will die a slow death.'
