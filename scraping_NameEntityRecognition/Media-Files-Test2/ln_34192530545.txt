34192530545;b"A series of defeats in the bypolls after the historic win in 2014 and tight contests in assembly elections in states like Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa has given a clear message to the BJP that the 2019 Lok Sabha polls are not going to be a cakewalk for the BJP. \n \nThe bypoll results thrown up by coming together of the opposition parties from Gorakhpur and Phulpur onwards have sent a clear message to the BJP that despite all the rhetoric the Modi-Yogi magic is on the wane and flaws have cropped up in Amit Shah's electoral arithmetic too. \n \nThe BJP's performance in the 2019 election is now expected to hinge largely on its ability to address the vulnerabilities like increasing fuel prices, unemployment, agrarian distress and the opposition's ability to exploit them. The BJP is also losing out on strength of its allies who have increasingly started to voice concerns about the party's methods and indicating that the electoral coalition could fracture. \n \nOne of the BJP's oldest allies, the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has put the BJP on notice. Another major ally the TDP has walked out. The Shiv Sena announced in January 2018 that it would contest the 2019 elections alone, rather than with the BJP. Looking ahead, the BJP's predicament is how to mobilize voters as an incumbent party. Though Amit Shah has given a clarion call to the party cadres to work for 51 per cent vote share to defeat the opposition parties' strategy to fight elections jointly, it is not going to be an easy task given the social complexities and Modi government's failure to deliver on the tall promises it had made to the electorates."
