The total revenue accrued in 2017-18 is Rs 26,794.11 crore. The figure for the previous corresponding period is Rs 26,995.25 crore. \n \nThe TASMAC liquor outlets were launched in 2003. Revenue earned through liquor sale touched the 10,000-crore mark in 2008-09. Minister for Electricity, Prohibition and Excise P Thangamani, in his reply during the debate on demand for grants, said TASMAC had 6,215 shops earlier. After closing down shops as per orders of the late Chief Minister, J Jayalalithaa and incumbent CM Edappadi K Palaniswami and the Supreme Court, the number of retail outlets in the State was now 3,866. \n \nStating that recently 800 shops had to be closed on SC orders, he said TN approached the apex court against the order only because people in border areas had been straying into neighbouring states. Reaffirming the governments resolve to implement prohibition, he said it would be done in a gradual manner. \n \nThe policy note said beer exports to other states fetched a revenue of Rs 161.69 crore during 2017-18 through collection of export fee and export licence fee. The figure for 2016-17 was Rs 87.09 crore while it stood at Rs 18.04 crore in 2015-16.'
