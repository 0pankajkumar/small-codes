34192733453;b'McLarens new50 million (Rs 448 crore) carbon fibre manufacturing centre in South Yorkshiremoved a significant step closer to operationtoday when executive directorRuth Nic Aoidh was handed the keys to the facility. \n \nAoidh said that, over the coming months, theMcLaren Composites Technology Centre (MCTC)"will be fitted out with the production equipment we need to become fully operational next year and support hundreds of skilled jobs". \n \nThe site, McLaren\'s first outsideits Woking home,is located in the Advanced Manufacturing Park in Catcliffe, between Sheffield and Rotherham. \n \nAlthough it\'s not yet operational, an earlier event to celebrate the facility\'s birthhas already seen aSenna hypercar perform doughnuts to christen the newly laid factory floor, which spans75,000sq ft. \n \n[embedded content]Around 45 McLaren employees are already located at the nearby University of Sheffields Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), which is partneringMcLaren. This team is set to grow to 200 and is working on pushing advances in carbon fibre tub technology. \n \nUsing the universitys facilities, McLarens team is making pre-production versions of itsone-piece\'MonoCell\' tubs that form the basis of its cars. Employees are therefore already gainingexperience of the build processes, which are said to embrace some new techniques and more automation. Additionally, McLaren is training apprentices who will work at the new facility. \n \nCurrently, the task of tub production is sub-contracted to a Salzburg-based company named Carbo Tech. Production of tubs will begin at the MCTC in 2019. \n \nThe British content of McLarens cars will increase from 50 percent to 58 percent when the Sheffield-made tubs are used. \n \nWhen the MCTC is fully operational, thecompleted tubs it makes will be transportedfrom Sheffield to the McLaren Production Centre in Wokingfor assembly into the finished cars. \n \nKen Smart, project director for the MCTC, said, There are two key reasons why we are developing this facility. First, taking control of the manufacture of the tub enables us to build in more design flexibility. So, as we develop the vehicles, we will be able to design the tubs to meet the features of those vehicles; things that matter to the customer, such as vehicle dynamics, ergonomics, space in the cabin, the driving position, visibility, ingress and egress." \n \n\n \nHe further adds,Second, and perhaps more importantly, it gives us the opportunity to continually learn from the development process. Every time we solve a problem, we learn something new." \n \nThat gives us the ability to modify the design for its structural integrity and gives us the ability to optimise the manufacturing processes yet further. Taking this technology in-house is giving us the opportunity to increase the pace of the design and development of the carbon fibre tub. \n \nThe new facility will also lead to a cost saving in the region of 10m (Rs 89 crore), according to McLaren chiefs,there is a potential for the MCTC tosupply carbon fibre components for other companies, because McLarens production targets for the foreseeable future will leave the Sheffield plant with surplus capacity when it is fully operational. \n \nAlso read: McLaren Automotive rolls out its 15,000th car in just seven years'
