34192688530;b"The resolution professional of Hyderabad-based diversified construction major IVRCL has ordered forensic audit of the company, forcing deferment of approval of the annual accounts. \n \nAt a meeting of the Committee of Creditors, the resolution professional had sought the approval of the committee members to the forensic audit of the books of accounts, which has been approved. \n \nA forensic audit would be a mammoth exercise as IVRCL, one of country's largest engineering and construction companies, has around 28 subsidiaries and special purpose vehicles for different projects with assets spread over the country. \n \nWhile forensic audits are normally carried out in cases where there are apprehensions of some abnormalities in the books of accounts, officials associated with the exercise tried to play down the development, saying the audit has to be carried out after the recent decision of banks for detailed examination of the books of all companies with loans of Rs 50 crore or above to determine future non-performing assets (NPAs). \n \nHowever, IVRCL has already turned NPA and is under the insolvency resolution process. \n \nThe decision to go for forensic audit could be one of the possible reasons why approval of the books of accounts, scheduled for Wednesday, has been postponed indefinitely and a nod being sought from the market regulator Securities Exchange Board of India, sources said. \n \nThe last date for extension of the submission of bids for the troubled construction player has been extended from May 24 to June 4. \n \nSources said the forensic audit as well as process of accepting bids would happen simultaneously and wouldn't impact the resolution process. \n \nThe resolution professional had earlier taken help of Feedback Infra, a well known infrastructure service provider promoted by Vinayak Chatterjee and also Belgium-headquartered BDO Restructuring Advisory to assist in the process compilation and scrutiny of claims, which have now touched Rs 13,406 crore. \n MINUTE SCRUTINY  A forensic audit would be a mammoth exercise as IVRCL has around 28 subsidiaries and special purpose vehicles for different projects with assets spread over the country   Sources said the forensic audit as well as process of accepting bids would happen simultaneously and wouldn't impact the resolution process"
