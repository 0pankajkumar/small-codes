34192565626;b'GlobeNewswire \n2018-05-31 Grand Challenges Canada, funded by the Government of Canada, supports 44 Stars in Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights  TORONTO, May 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grand Challenges Canada is proud to announce an investment of over CAD$10 million to test 100 new ideas to address persistent challenges in womens and childrens health in low- and middle-income countries. CAD $4 million of this is dedicated to 44 projects addressing sexual and reproductive health and rights, putting Canadas Feminist International Assistance Policy into action.  \nProposed by institutions in Canada and abroad, the bold ideas embrace a range of creative solutions to empower the lives and improve the health of some of the worlds poorest and most vulnerable women and children in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe. \n \nThe projects will each receive a seed grant of CAD$100,000 to develop and test their innovations, funded by Grand Challenges Canada, with financial support from the Government of Canada provided through Global Affairs Canada. \n \nNOTABLE INNOVATIONS IN SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS \n \nReversing Stigma and Maternal Mortality in Northern Nigeria \nThe Deliver Health Foundation will implement a trauma-focused care training for midwives, and an anti-stigma campaign to improve the sexual and reproductive health for women and girls returned from Boko Haram. The violence of Boko Haram has caused over 2 million people to flee their homes. Resulting insecurity created a lack of maternal healthcare resources for vulnerable displaced populations. For survivors of sexual violence, pregnancy can be a traumatizing experience without the support structures of family and community, which can lead to delivery complications and an increased risk of maternal mortality. \n \nEmoji Pendant Helps Young Women  Make Smart Reproductive Choices in Rural India \nThe Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre is looking to assist rural women in India with the creation of a personalized, accessible, data-driven, women-centric strategy for sexual and reproductive wellness and clinical care in the form of a wearable pendant. This technology will track health data on menstruation, clinical signs, symptoms, body temperature, and heart rate, and display information with different coloured emojis. The wearable pendant connects to a smartphone app to deliver wellness indicators to nearby clinical providers, where women can access self-controlled, high-quality tailored health services, using data to inform smart choices. Such choices will inform their reproductive and sexual lives and reduce morbidity and mortality. \n \nCombatting Chaupadi and Empowering Women in Rural Nepal \nNyaya Health Nepal will combat Chaupadi; a practice that forces menstruating women to inhabit cramped sheds away from their home. While outlawed, the practice continues, leaving young women vulnerable and perpetuates the inferior status of females. Despite recent progressive healthcare policies, over 10 million Nepalis lack access to healthcare, due to fragmented infrastructures, a decade-long civil war, and the 2015 earthquake. Nyaya Health Nepals network of local female community health workers (CHWs) will integrate with government hospitals to reach rural populations to provide counseling of women and their families, engagement with local elected leaders, sensitization trainings for hospital workers, and monitoring through a digital system. The networks CHWs exercise a distributed task sharing model of counselling and critical health information sharing, and can cover a wider catchment area in this mountainous country than the state healthcare system. \n\nDescriptions of all projects are in the following Appendix, with innovations delivered by social enterprises, non-profit organizations, research institutes, universities, foundations, and hospitals. \n \nOver the past seven years, Grand Challenges Canadas Stars in Global Health program has provided CAN$70 million to 661 projects, implemented in 87 low- and middle-income countries over 9 rounds of funding since 2011. Fifteen of the most promising of these Stars in Global Health innovations that have received Transition To Scale funding, have the potential to save 1.1 million lives, and improve 18.5 million lives by 2030. \n \nGrand Challenges Canada is committed to supporting bold ideas and is proud to support the Government of Canada in realizing its Feminist International Assistance Policy. Canadas ongoing global leadership in development innovation will accelerate achievement of the sustainable development goals. \n \n Dr. Karlee Silver, Vice President Programs, Grand Challenges Canada \n \nABOUT GRAND CHALLENGES CANADA \n \nGrand Challenges Canada is dedicated to supporting Bold Ideas with Big Impact  .

Ekialo Kionas Health Navigation (HN) model strengthens the emergency referral system for mothers and newborns by establishing a durable pathway for healthy pregnancies, safe deliveries, and effective referrals. This innovation mobilizes local experts, community health volunteers (CHVs), to act as educators, skilled referral coordinators, and patient advocates. Financed through a community-managed fund, CHVs fill planning and communication gaps that make families vulnerable during emergencies. \n \nGlobal Integration and Innovation Africa Limited \nAkili (Smart) Mom Project : Increasing Access to Family Planning to Young Mothers \n \nThis project is a supply chain innovation involving a product bundling model, leveraging an existing network of women micro-entrepreneurs. The two-prong social entrepreneurship looks to improve the choice and access to family planning products; as well as access to weaning food for infants through the bundling of food for sale, and provision of free contraceptives. These two products would be simultaneously marketed to a target group, the mothers of infants in rural areas, who have co-existing needs of pregnancy spacing and sourcing appropriate infant food. The project aims to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of bundling contraceptive distribution with infant nutrition to low-income customers to reduce distribution costs. Goals include a 50% increase in contraceptive use by mothers of infants; a 20% rise in their long term contraceptive use, and a 20% reduction in the number of subsequent pregnancies less than 2 years apart. \n \nGolden Girls Foundation \nMentor-peer training for school girls to reduce resistance to menstrual cup uptake and counter cultural taboos in impoverished communities \n \nMenstruating schoolgirls in Kenya have little access to affordable menstrual products. In turn, they frequently struggle with shame surrounding the use of unhygienic menstrual solutions, which poses health risks to young girls, and often prevents them from participating in school during menstruation. A lack of access to hygienic menstrual products in turn prevents school aged girls from learning, and engaging in life both inside and outside of school.  \n\n \nThe project designs and tests a school-based program to mentor adolescent girls in menstrual hygiene management. The program goals include identifying, educating and providing menstrual supplies to 10,000 girls in 100 schools; recruiting, training and supporting up to 500 local female mentors; a 60% increase in schoolgirls knowledegable about the correct practice of menstrual cups, and a 60% rise in schoolgirls attending school during menses. \n \nInstitute of Primate Research \nCloud-Based Maternal and Child Healthcare Record System with Vaccination Registration and Alerts in Kwale County, Kenya \n \nThe project is developing, implementing and testing a cloud-based vaccination tracking system, shared across multiple Kenyan Kwale County public hospitals and vaccination outreach programs.
