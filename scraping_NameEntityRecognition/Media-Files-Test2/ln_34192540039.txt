Swiggy will appear in WhatsApp chat interfaces on consumers' smartphones and will keep them abreast of their order status in real-time, providing a more seamless communications system. \nHowever, the company said consumers have the option to opt out of the WhatsApp services at any point in time by just replying with 'STOP' to Swiggy's WhatsApp chats. \n\nOn the other hand, Swiggy will continue providing SMS updates to consumers who are not on the messaging platform. \n\nWith this new integration, Swiggy aims to further enhance utility and convenience for its consumers. \n\nThis service is already available for a few users and will be rolled out to all users in the following weeks."
