The Congress knows that a sustained campaign and questioning the BJP on the promises and claims can tilt the balance in its favour. \n \nUnder Rahul Gandhi, the Congress also seems to have understood that it will have to put its ego on the side and take junior role in coalitions if it wants to play a role in halting the BJP. \n \nSo far the opposition leaders have played by the rule book by side stepping their egos and keeping the focus only on the winning factor against the BJP. The decision to allow underdog RLD to take on the BJP in Kairana was one such silver lining that shows that if the opposition parties want they can work jointly to win. \n \nThe results have shown that caste and minority factor, especially Muslims, Dalits and some OBCs are again set to play a major role in the 2019 elections as the BJP has failed to reign in saffron vigilantes and convince the subaltern about its sincerity. \n \nThe real test of the opposition parties, however, will be there to before the 2019 elections  whether they will be able to solve the arithmetic of seat-sharing and satisfy its wannabe candidates and cadres or perish like KC Tyagi of JDU says because of the inherent contradictions among alliance partners. \n \nThe answer to this depends on the mettle of the young crop of leaders  Akhilesh Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav, Jayant Choudhary, Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati."
