# Questionâ€‹ : Given a directed graph, find the shortest path between two nodes if one exists.

'''
Dijistra's algorithm
--------------------

# Get an array per node and mark all positions as infinity
	this is the initial guess of distance from our destination.
# Start with source node and mark distance to itself as 0 and mark as visited
	current node is start node
# Keep looping untill all all nodes are visited
	@ Reach to all nodes possible from current node
	@ If distance marked for that node is less than my distance+the path between us, replace it
	@ Select the min from the list of distances and go to that vertex next
	@ That node is now the next node
# After the loop ends the shortest distance to any node from source nodes can be found from
	the given array
